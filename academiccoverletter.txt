Dear Professor,

I am Vibhor Aggarwal, a Master's student in Automotive Engineering at RWTH Aachen, Germany. I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India.  I am writing to inquire, and discuss about the student position available for the System simulation of an underground wheel loader.

I have vivid experience using Matlab/Simulink, Computer Aided Designing, Simulation over Ansys, Gazebo, etc.

I worked as a Research Fellow on low level joint-torque control of the Humanoid robot, iCub, at Italian Institute of technology (IIT), Genova, in Italy for almost a year. It required me to design the control framework on Matlab/Simulink.  I also worked as a Vehicle Dynamics engineer in the Motorsports team of the college, wherein we designed and manufactured two off-road vehicles, and as an engineer for Engine Plant Maintenance in a big Automotive Company. 
I led the team of more than 20 people, as a Captain of the Motorsports team; during the period we were successful to design the first transparent and lightweight Gearbox, and one of the lightest vehicle in Indian student motorsports'.
I also worked on a Robotic Exoskeleton Arm, which was awarded with the Best Under Graduate project among all the graduating students. 
I would like to show you more photos and videos of the projects, which can be seen here: https://vibhoraggarwal.github.io/_pages/projects/

I want to know and discuss further about the position?
